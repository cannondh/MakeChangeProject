# Make Change Project - Skill Distillery Week 1 Homework

### Description

The program is very simple and works with eclipse's interface. To use the program you run it. You will be prompted to provide the choice for the item you're purchasing. This can be in whole number or decimal number fashion. much like money.

Next the program will dole out the correct change in descending denomination of dollar bills and coins for you.

### Lessons Learned

Equations are very hard. I know why I need something two decimal places over to be a whole number, but the computer doesn't know. I also know when I don't need a number to be a whole number. But the computer has to have its mind changed to change back.

I'm still not completely used to the syntax and loops, but methods and if-statements were a gamechanger in the major breakthroughs i had in this project. I really had to bash my head against a wall to find the tiny mistakes i made. I questions many times over the course of this coding challenge whether or not I knew basic math. Sometimes i had to go to the internet to check my sanity and reassure that i do. Though there was one time I didn't. We don't talk about that.
